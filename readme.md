Status: Under active development — contributions welcome!

This project is an experimental sandboxing and isolation framework that integrates [Firejail](https://firejail.wordpress.com/) to provide a secure runtime environment for Linux applications.
The goal is to enhance process-level security by leveraging Linux kernel features such as namespaces, seccomp filters, and capabilities to reduce attack surfaces and privilege exposure.

***Development Status:***
This project is still under active development.
Many components, including the integration modules, documentation, and testing suites, are experimental.
